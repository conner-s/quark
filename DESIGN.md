# Quark — A CLI-Styled Matrix Client

The authoritative spec and reference for Quark: architecture, UI layout, Matrix
feature support, the vim keybinding config syntax (`quarkrc`), theming (TOML
structure), and config files. Read it before implementing a new feature.

Work — bugs, features, and release QA — is tracked in
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/mcplummet/quark/issues), not in this file.

## Overview

Quark is a keyboard-driven, CLI-aesthetic Matrix client that renders in a GUI window (not a raw terminal) to support inline images, custom emoji, and stickers. It uses vim-style navigation throughout and offers deep theme customization.

```

**Why Tauri over Electron?** ~10x smaller binary, ~3-5x less RAM. The Rust backend uses `matrix-sdk` directly — the same SDK powering Element X — giving us best-in-class E2EE and protocol coverage without FFI wrappers.

**Why not a real TUI?** Inline custom emoji (`<img data-mx-emoticon>`) and stickers require rendering images inline with text flow. Terminal image protocols (Sixel/Kitty) can't do this reliably across terminals. The CLI aesthetic is achieved purely through CSS (monospace fonts, dark background, prompt-style input).

### Backend (Rust)

The backend handles all Matrix protocol interaction and exposes commands to the frontend via Tauri's IPC.

**Crates:**
- `matrix-sdk` — client, sync, room operations, E2EE (Vodozemac)
- `matrix-sdk-crypto` — cross-signing, key backup, device verification
- `tauri` — windowing, IPC, system tray, file dialogs
- `serde` / `serde_json` — serialization
- `tokio` — async runtime
- `directories` — XDG-compliant config/data paths

**Responsibilities:**
- Login (OIDC via MAS + legacy password fallback)
- Sync loop, room list management & subscriptions — classic v3 `/sync` (see *Core Protocol* below)
- Sending/receiving messages, reactions, edits, redactions
- E2EE: device verification (SAS emoji, QR), key backup, cross-signing
- Media download/upload with authenticated media (MSC3916)
- Custom emoji/sticker pack resolution (MSC2545)
- Theme file loading and validation
- Local encrypted database — matrix-sdk SQLite store opened with a keyring-held passphrase; store key + session in the OS keyring (`secrets.rs`)

### Frontend (TypeScript)

A single-page app styled as a terminal interface. No framework required initially — vanilla TS + a lightweight reactive layer (Preact or Solid) if needed.

**Responsibilities:**
- Rendering the message timeline (text, images, replies, threads, reactions, custom emoji, stickers)
- Vim-mode input handling and command bar
- Emoji/sticker picker (keyboard-navigable)
- Theme application from user config
- Room list, member list, space hierarchy display

### Mobile lifecycle

iOS reclaims memory by killing the WKWebView's *content* process while an app is backgrounded. The app process itself survives, so the app resumes to a live window wrapping a dead page — a blank screen that nothing but a force-quit clears (#39). Tauri ≥ 2.11 implements WebKit's `webViewWebContentProcessDidTerminate:` callback and reloads the webview in response, which is why `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` floors `tauri` at `2.11` rather than `2`; dropping back to a 2.10.x lock reintroduces the blank screen.

Recovery is a full page reload, so it costs the user their scroll position and any unsent draft. The reloaded page re-runs the normal startup path — `restore_session` reads the session back out of the keyring and lands on the room list — and because `start_sync` aborts any running loop before spawning one, a reload can never leave two sync loops polling the homeserver.

### Push notifications

Desktop holds a live sync connection, so it never needs push. Mobile does: iOS
suspends a backgrounded app outright, and on Android the alternative is
`SyncForegroundService` holding the connection open — which costs battery, shows
a permanent shade entry, and loses to Doze and OEM task-killers. Push inverts
that: the homeserver POSTs to a **push gateway**, the gateway wakes the device
through the platform transport, and the device runs a bounded sync.

Two invariants shape the design.

**Nothing readable leaves the homeserver.** Every pusher registers with
`format: event_id_only` (`push.rs`), so a push carries a room id, an event id
and an unread count — no ciphertext, no sender, no room name. Turning that back
into a notification happens on-device through the existing `notify` pipeline,
which is why `notify::evaluate` is pure and transport-agnostic: the same
function serves the warm sync path and a push-woken one.

**Filtering has to be server-side.** A locally-muted room the homeserver doesn't
know about still wakes the phone for every message, only for the device to
discard it — the exact cost push exists to remove. So muting a room sets the
Matrix push rule (`commands.rs::set_room_mute`), which also syncs the mute to the
user's other clients.

**The push rule is the mute; `mute_rooms` records only the attempts that
failed.** Once the rule exists it empties `push_actions`, and `notify::evaluate`
drops anything the push rules didn't select — so the room is already silenced
without consulting the local list at all. The list earns its place on exactly one
path: `set_room_mute` is best-effort, and if the rule write fails the local entry
is what stops a mute appearing to do nothing on this device.

It holds *only* those failures. A successful mute is not recorded, and a retry
that succeeds clears the earlier failure (`commands::apply_mute_attempt`).
Recording successful mutes too is what stopped the list doing its one job: an
entry could then mean either "the write failed, silence this here" or "this
synced long ago and has since been unmuted from another client", the two are
indistinguishable, and so the two readers chose differently — `should_notify`
honoured every entry while the in-app toast ignored any entry for a room it had
cached. A room muted while the homeserver was unreachable came out silent with
the window unfocused and toasting on every message with it focused. Now an entry
means one thing, both gates honour it unconditionally, and they agree.

That narrow job has three consequences worth stating, because treating the list
as a general-purpose fallback gets each of them wrong:

- **Nothing reconciles the two.** Both are written by the same command and never
  compared afterwards, so a mute set from another client is invisible in the
  list — which is why the ruleset, not the list, is what the UI asks.
- **The list must not be read for display.** It answers "did we try to mute this
  here", not "is this room muted", and those diverge whenever the above happens.
  UI that asks the question must ask the ruleset.
- **A failed rule write cannot stay silent.** `mute_room` / `unmute_room` return
  a `MuteOutcome` (`notifications.rs`) saying whether the rule reached the
  homeserver, and the frontend surfaces the warning. Deliberately not an `Err`:
  the change *did* take effect locally, so failing the whole call would
  misreport it. The two failures carry different messages because they cost
  different things — a failed mute only wastes battery, while a failed unmute
  leaves a rule that keeps the room silent on every client while this one shows
  it as unmuted.

Unmuting must never be the half that fails. A server-side Mute rule empties
`push_actions`, and `notify::evaluate` drops anything the push rules didn't
select — so a rule left behind after the local list says "unmuted" silences the
room permanently while the UI insists otherwise. Unmuting normally needs the
room's shape (encrypted? one-to-one?) to know which default to restore, which a
room not yet synced can't supply; rather than skip the rule, that case clears the
room's user-defined rules outright so the account default applies.

Because these each have an effect outside the config file, **`set_notification_config`
only accepts the fields Settings owns** (`NotificationConfig::with_preferences`):
enabled, preview, sender. Mutes, background sync and push have
dedicated commands, and the Settings dialog builds its draft from a config it
cached when it opened — so treating that draft as authoritative would let [save]
silently undo a mute or a push opt-out taken while the dialog was open.

The transports differ, and so does what each costs to run:

| Platform | Transport | Gateway | Infrastructure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | UnifiedPush (ntfy, NextPush, …) | the distributor's own, found by discovery, else `matrix.gateway.unifiedpush.org` | none — the UnifiedPush gateway is a protocol translator holding no secrets, so any client may use it |
| iOS | APNs | self-hosted Sygnal at `push.quark.tel` | required — only the holder of the APNs key for `tel.quark.app` can push to it |

`push_gateway_override` in `notifications.toml` beats discovery
(`push.rs::resolve_gateway`) — the escape hatch for a distributor that
advertises no Matrix gateway. It is deliberately not editable from Settings:
pointing a device at the wrong gateway silently stops push, and nothing in the
UI could explain the failure.

`app_id` is part of the deployment contract, since Sygnal keys its config
literally by that string: `tel.quark.app.android`, and `tel.quark.app.ios.dev` /
`.ios.prod` for the two APNs environments. iOS registrations also carry a
`default_payload` with `mutable-content: 1`, without which iOS never routes the
push through the notification service extension.

Push is opt-in and off by default (`push_enabled` in `notifications.toml`),
toggled in Settings → Notifications. That section appears only where the
platform is capable *and* the build wires a transport up
(`push.rs::supports_push`). Both mobile platforms now satisfy both halves —
Android through UnifiedPush, iOS through APNs — but the claims stay separate
rather than collapsing into one const, because a capable platform whose build
supplies no pushkey would otherwise advertise a toggle that can never leave
"waiting". That is exactly what iOS was between the shared plumbing landing and
the APNs transport landing. The opt-in is enforced inside
`push::register`, not by each transport remembering to check: registration is
what hands a third-party gateway this device's address, so the gate belongs on
the handing over.

**On iOS the opt-in is the master notification switch**, not a second one.
`derivedPushEnabled` (`app/notifications.ts`) sets `push_enabled` from
`enabled` and the OS permission together, on login and on every settings save,
and the Settings toggle there reports rather than sets — a flip would be undone
by the next save. iOS has no other way to hear about a message while the app is
closed: no background-sync service, no connection left open. A separate opt-in
could therefore only produce the state where notifications are on and nothing
ever arrives. Android keeps its own switch, because background sync is a real
alternative there and choosing a distributor is choosing who carries this
device's traffic. The permission is part of the condition for the same reason
registration is gated at all: a pusher for a device that cannot display
anything hands the gateway an address for nothing.

**"Enabled" and "working" are different states**, and everything between them is
software Quark doesn't control — a distributor the user installs, a gateway that
may decline, a homeserver round-trip that may fail. `PushReadiness` names the
five (`off`, `muted_account`, `no_transport`, `waiting`, `ready`) and Settings
reports them separately, because collapsing any two produces the failure push
can least afford: telling someone it works while nothing delivers it.
`no_transport` earns its own state on Android as both the likeliest cause and
the only one the user can fix — the foreground service remains the fallback
there.

The push section shows a one-line status for the current state and, beneath
it, a hint only when there is something for the user to do (install a
distributor, or re-enable notifications at the top of the tab); other states
show no hint. Settings copy in general is user guidance, not an explanation of
how a feature works — rationale like what the gateway sees lives here (#113).

**`muted_account` is the rung that is not about this device at all.**
`.m.rule.master` is an account-wide kill switch — one override rule matching
every event and notifying on nothing — which Quark never writes and other
clients expose as "disable all notifications". While it is set the homeserver
notifies for nothing on any client, so every rung below it can be green while
not a single push is sent. That is exactly the failure this ladder exists to
refuse, and it is invisible locally, which is why readiness consults the ruleset
and not just the pusher and the transport. It is read from the SDK's cached
ruleset (`Account::push_rules`, a state-store read of the `m.push_rules`
account-data event, *not* a `GET /_matrix/client/v3/pushrules/`), so status
costs nothing and stays correct as sync carries another client's change in.

It outranks the device-level rungs, because installing a distributor fixes a
chain that will still deliver nothing; it does not outrank `off`, since a user
who never opted into push is not owed an account-wide diagnosis inside the push
section. The mute also empties `push_actions` on the warm sync path, so it
silences a desktop build — which renders no push section at all — just as
completely. Settings therefore reports it twice: as a readiness state inside the
push section, and as a notice at the top of the Notifications tab carrying the
button that clears it (`set_account_mute`, a real homeserver write with no local
cache to fall back on, so a failure is an `Err` and the notice stays). The
button is the point: the rule was written by another client, so without it the
only way out of the state Quark has just diagnosed is to go and find that
client. Note the inversion — the rule being *enabled* means notifications are
*off* — and that absence is not silence: a ruleset with no master rule is not
muted.

Per-room mute rules set on other clients are a narrower case and are handled
separately: `RoomInfo.muted` resolves each room's `RoomNotificationMode` from
the same locally-cached ruleset, so a room muted in Element shows its muted
marker in Quark's room list and the Room Info dialog offers `[unmute]` rather
than `[mute]`. That is a per-room read on the room-list refresh path, and it is
affordable because the ruleset is evaluated in memory — one store read plus an
N-room match, not N round-trips. The local `mute_rooms` list stays as the
offline fallback for a room the client store has not seen.

The ladder asks about a **registered pusher first**, ahead of the transport
probe. `transport_status` cannot distinguish a device with no distributor from
a probe that failed — the Kotlin `status` command catches its own errors and
answers with an empty list — so checking it first let a binder hiccup report a
device that was happily receiving pushes as having nothing installed. A live
pusher is positive evidence the whole chain worked, and no probe result
afterwards is better news than that.

**More than one distributor is a state, not an error.** The connector declines
to guess which installed app should carry this device's push traffic, which is
the right call and, on its own, a dead end: registration fails and readiness
sits at `waiting` with nothing the user can act on. So `PushStatus` carries the
whole `distributors` list, Settings offers it as a choice, and
`select_push_distributor` commits to one. Reporting a stall the user cannot
resolve is the failure this section exists to prevent, and it applies as much
to *too many* transports as to none.

#### Android: the cold path

A push arrives at a process that may have no Tauri in it at all, which is what
makes this more than a second sync trigger.

`PushEventService` (the connector's `PushService`; `MessagingReceiver` is
deprecated in 3.x) receives everything the distributor sends and hands messages
to `PushSyncService`, a `shortService` foreground service — a broadcast receiver
gets about ten seconds, and a cold sync that is killed partway through has spent
the battery without showing the notification it was woken for. When Android
refuses a background foreground-service start, the work runs inline on the still
alive `PushEventService` rather than being dropped. When it refuses *later* —
the start succeeded but `startForeground` did not — the service stops itself
immediately and finishes the push as an ordinary background service. Pressing on
is the one thing it must not do: a service started with `startForegroundService`
that never reaches the foreground is killed outright, so swallowing a recoverable
refusal converts it into a certain kill.

From there it crosses into Rust through `push_jni.rs`, the one place Kotlin
calls Rust without Tauri in between. It owns what Tauri would otherwise have
provided: an async runtime, a panic boundary (unwinding into the JVM is
undefined behaviour), and a logcat sink — the app's `tracing` subscriber writes
to stdout, which Android discards, and is installed by `run()`, which never
executes here. Without that sink a failing push is completely silent.

`push_wake::run_wake` then runs a **bounded sync**, not a fetch of the single
event the push named. The SDK's `Vec<Action>` extractor hands the handler the
homeserver's own push-rule evaluation, so `notify::evaluate` sees inputs
identical to the warm path — same mutes, same highlight decision, no second
decision matrix to drift — and the sync sweeps up everything else that arrived
in the same window. The rendered `NotificationSpec`s serialise back to Kotlin,
where `PushNotifier` posts them; matching the notification plugin's ids,
channels, group keys and *intent extras* is what makes a tap on one route
through the plugin's `actionPerformed` event and MainActivity's cold-start
mirror alike.

**Warm notifications on Android post through `PushNotifier` too**, called
over JNI (`push_jni::post_notifications`) rather than through
tauri-plugin-notification. `MainActivity.onCreate` hands Rust the JVM, the
application context and the `PushNotifier` class once (`nativeInstall`) —
the class resolved on a Java thread, since `FindClass` from a native thread
sees only the system class loader. The plugin could not stay, for two
reasons. Every plugin call dispatches onto the Activity, and wry `expect`s
one: a process that outlived its Activity (kept by a foreground service, or
just not yet reclaimed) panicked on its first notification, inside the sync
loop that raised it. And its tap intents use `FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT`, which
kills the old PendingIntent before the replacement row is posted — the room
summary is re-posted under one id per message, so a tap in that window hit a
dead intent and closed the shade on nothing (#87). One notifier also means
one set of request codes, flags and summary rules instead of two that
drifted. Dismissal (`notify::cancel_room`) goes the same way. The plugin
remains only as a fallback for a notifier that failed to install, and for
iOS. The summary alerts with `GROUP_ALERT_CHILDREN` and only once, so its
per-message re-post does not sound on top of the message's own alert.

The foreground-service placeholder ("Checking for new messages") carries a
launch intent: it sits in the shade beside the real row on every push, and
without one a tap on it closed the shade and did nothing.

Several guards matter here, all of them against work this app has previously
overwhelmed its own homeserver with:

- **A warm app wins — while it is actually working.** `push_wake` keeps a
  process-wide flag set by `start_sync`, *and* a clock stamped every time the
  loop completes a sync. Deferring on the flag alone asked the wrong question:
  an Android process kept resident but frozen by Doze still owns a sync task, so
  every push stood down for a loop stalled at the top of its backoff ladder —
  push declining to work in precisely the situation it was added for. A loop
  that has not synced within `WARM_SYNC_LIVENESS_MS` no longer holds push off.
  The progress stamp comes from `sync_with_callback`, because `Client::sync`
  loops internally and returns only on error: its success arm is reached about
  as often as never.

  Even a loop inside that window only *probably* delivers, so an event push
  does not stand down flat: it **hands off** (`WakePlan::HandOff`), waiting up
  to `WARM_HANDOFF` (10 s) for the warm handler to report that it has processed
  that very event id (`note_warm_event`, stamped at the end of
  `events::maybe_notify` for messages and stickers, and by a catch-all
  timeline handler for everything else the push rules fire on — undecryptable
  events, redactions, polls, calls). An invite carries no event id in sync, so
  its push is answered instead by the room showing up as invited in the warm
  client. A loop that stays silent through the handoff is
  restarted, exactly like a stalled one below — never raced. Standing
  down outright lost the event in the commonest Android state of all — a
  resident process the OS has frozen. The clock was stamped just before the
  freeze and read as live; the push service stopped at once, and the process
  was re-frozen before the loop it deferred to had run (#90). The wait is what
  keeps it thawed: the service holds the foreground, which also exempts it from
  Doze's network cut, for as long as the loop needs. Counts-only pushes still
  stand down, since a warm app clears the room from the receipt itself.
- **A stalled loop is restarted, never raced.** An event push that finds the
  loop running but stalled (`WarmSync::Stalled`) does not sync beside it: the
  wake would be handed the app's own `Client`, and two syncs on one client are
  two concurrent E2EE outgoing-request flushes from one device (#52). Instead
  `client::restart_sync` aborts the loop and spawns a fresh one — on Tauri's
  runtime, since the wake's JNI runtime dies when it returns — and the wake
  waits, within its budget, for the new loop's first completed sync, which
  delivers the event through the warm handlers. A restart never revives a loop
  that was stopped: the "is one running?" check, the abort and the spawn all
  happen under the `SyncState` lock logout also takes. Restarting stamps the
  liveness clock, so a burst restarts the loop once. A dismissal push needs no
  sync and leaves a stalled loop alone.
- **One syncer per client, structurally.** `JoinHandle::abort` only requests
  cancellation, so "abort the old loop, spawn the new one" used to leave a
  window with both polling. Every syncer — the warm loop for its lifetime, a
  wake for its bounded sync — holds `client::SYNC_TURN`, so a replacement
  begins only once its predecessor has actually been dropped.
- **A burst coalesces.** `WakeGuard` admits one push sync at a time, released on
  `Drop` so a panicking sync reopens it instead of wedging push shut.
- **One `Client` per store.** `background_client` reuses the app's client when
  there is one; two `Client`s over one store means two `OlmMachine`s, the
  documented cause of Olm-account corruption. Where no Tauri exists the cold
  client is built once and shared, through a `ClientCell` whose real job is not
  caching but refusing to build twice at once — the wake path holds `WakeGuard`
  but the distributor callbacks (`register_stored_endpoint`, `on_unregistered`)
  hold nothing, and an endpoint re-announced alongside a queued message is an
  ordinary wake-up, not an exotic race. A mutex rather than a `OnceCell`,
  because the slot also has to be *emptied*, and a `OnceCell` in a `static`
  never can be. The client owns I/O registered against the runtime each JNI
  entry point builds and drops per call, so one cached past that point would
  leave the next push driving a dead reactor; and once Tauri starts in the same
  process the app builds its own client over the same store, which is the
  two-`OlmMachine` hazard again. So it is released before a runtime goes, and
  when the app takes over.
- **Collectors come off the client again.** The cold path registers the warm
  path's own event handlers, and both clients it may register them against
  outlive the wake. A leaked handler goes on racing `events::maybe_notify` for
  `claim_notification`, and each race it wins is a notification the user never
  sees — the spec is claimed into a `Vec` nobody reads. Hence drop guards.
- **A cut-short wake still posts what it rendered.** The 20 s `WAKE_BUDGET` and
  a failing sync both used to return an error and drop everything the handlers
  had already collected. That loses those notifications permanently, not
  temporarily: matrix-sdk persists the sync token *before* it dispatches
  handlers, so by the time a spec exists the homeserver already counts this
  device as having read that far, and no later sync offers the event again. The
  collector's output therefore lives in `run_wake`, outside the future
  `timeout` can cancel, and `salvage` posts whatever is in it — still capped —
  whenever the sync ends early with something to show. The error survives only
  when there is nothing to salvage, because "empty because it timed out" and
  "empty because nothing was worth showing" are different bug reports.

**A wake can also subtract.** A counts-only push carries no event but does carry
a room id, and it is what a homeserver sends when the room was read on another
device. That is answered with a dismissal — `WakeOutcome.dismiss`, honoured by
`PushNotifier.cancelRoom` — without a client, a lease or a byte of network. The
alternative is notifications the user already dealt with elsewhere sitting in
the shade until they next open the app.

"Read elsewhere" is a claim, though, and `counts.unread` is what backs it. A
counts push whose count went *up* is a badge update, not a room the user has
dealt with, and dismissing on it would clear notifications they have never seen
— so only a count that is absent or zero dismisses (`IgnoreReason::StillUnread`
covers the rest). Absent still dismisses because not every homeserver sends
counts, and silence is not evidence the room is still waiting.

Notification dismissal asks Android for the live set rather than the in-process
registry, which only knows what *this* process posted — after a cold push it is
empty while the shade is not. The room id doubles as the notification group key
(`notify.rs`), which is what makes a dismissal addressable at all.

Gateway discovery probes the endpoint's **origin** (`unifiedpush.rs`): the path
and query identify this device's mailbox, not the server's capabilities. A
refusal (401/403/404/405/406) is trustworthy and falls back to the public
gateway, which is how a plain ntfy.sh user gets working push with no setup. A
5xx or a dead socket is *not* a refusal, and keeps the user's own host — the two
mistakes are not symmetric. Falling back would route their room and event ids
through a third party silently and durably, since the choice is persisted;
keeping their host risks an outage they can see in Settings and fix.

**Already-read is asked of the read markers, and of all four of them.** A wake
syncs a batch, so most of what it sees may already have been read elsewhere;
`already_seen` drops those. The signal has to come from the *private* receipt as
much as the public one: `mark_room_read` sends `m.read` only when the
`send_read_receipts` preference is on, while `m.read.private` always goes out.
Consulting the public receipt alone made the filter a permanent no-op for
everyone who had turned that preference off — silently, because a filter that
never fires is indistinguishable from one with nothing to do. Both receipt types
are read, unthreaded and main, and the newest wins.

#### iOS: the notification service extension

iOS has no cold path in the Android sense, because there is nothing to wake: the
app is suspended or gone, and it does not get to run. What runs instead is a
**notification service extension** (`gen/apple/QuarkNSE`), a second process iOS
launches for each push carrying `mutable-content: 1`, with roughly 30 seconds
and 24 MB to rewrite the notification before it is shown. Without that flag —
emitted in the pusher's `default_payload` by `push::apns_default_payload` — the
extension is never consulted and the user sees the `loc-key` placeholder.

Nothing registers for remote notifications at launch. `main.mm` installs the
delegate callbacks and stops there; asking APNs for a token is a call Rust makes
(`apns::request_device_token`, handed in as a function pointer like the rest of
the ObjC side) once push is actually enabled, so an install that never opts in
never mints a token or hands the gateway an address. The notification
*permission* is likewise the frontend's to request, after login where the prompt
follows something the user just did — the launch-time ask arrived in front of
the login screen and pre-empted it. A token without permission is harmless: it
arrives, and nothing is displayed until they agree.

`is_permission_granted` answers `null` for two unrelated states — never asked
(`PermissionState::Prompt`) and unanswerable (desktop, mock mode, a build
without the plugin) — so `app/notifications.ts` keeps them apart as `prompt` and
`unavailable`. Reading the first as the second means a fresh install is never
prompted and, because push follows the permission on iOS, never registers a
pusher either.

The homeserver POSTs to our own Sygnal at `push.quark.tel`, which signs for APNs;
`apns.rs` is the transport module, and unlike `unifiedpush.rs` it discovers
nothing. The OS is the transport and the only gateway that can sign for
`tel.quark.app` is the one holding the APNs key, so both are constants. The
pushkey is the device token base64-encoded, because Sygnal's
`convert_device_token_to_hex` default makes it base64-*decode* what it is given;
hex registers cleanly and never delivers. `app_id` selects sandbox or production
(`tel.quark.app.ios.dev` / `.prod`) and must agree with the `aps-environment`
entitlement the app was signed with — a mismatch fails silently at APNs,
visible only in Sygnal's logs. So it is not chosen by a second switch that
could disagree: `apns::detect_sandbox` reads the entitlement back out of the
bundle's embedded provisioning profile at runtime, making registration follow
the signature whatever the build flags were (`debug_assertions` was the old
proxy, and a release-profile build signed for development registered `.prod`
against a sandbox token). An absent profile is the App Store's doing and means
production; the simulator, which has tokens but no profile, is pinned sandbox
at compile time; only an unreadable profile falls back to the compile-time
guess.

**Tauri owns the app delegate**, so there is no compile-time place to put the
remote-notification callbacks: `main.mm` adds them at runtime to whichever class
wry instantiated, then re-assigns the delegate to itself so UIKit re-reads which
methods exist. A token that arrives before Tauri's `setup()` has resolved a
config dir is parked in `apns.rs` and drained by `settle_pending_pushers`; APNs
does not re-issue on request, so without that the ordering would leave push dead
until the next launch.

**The extension is Swift only** — no Rust, no matrix-sdk, and so no decryption.
It resolves the room id and event id the pusher sends with one authenticated
`/context` request and renders as a **communication notification**: it donates
an `INSendMessageIntent` and rewrites the content from it, which is the only
API iOS offers for putting a real avatar and a native sender/group header on a
notification. DMs — recognisable as rooms with no `m.room.name` — wear the
sender's avatar and title as just the sender; named rooms wear the room's
avatar, each falling back to the other. This needs the Communication
Notifications entitlement and `NSUserActivityTypes` naming `INSendMessageIntent`
— both on the *app*, not the extension: iOS validates the styled rendering
against the host app's entitlements even though the extension donates the
intent, and a profile for the extension's App ID refuses the key outright. When
any of that is missing, iOS declines the intent and the plain title/body
rendering — the same shape as `notifications::format_notification` — still
stands. With `show_sender` off the intent is skipped outright: it exists
to display exactly what that flag hides. `threadIdentifier` is set to the room
id the moment it is known, before any fetch, so even a notification whose
resolution failed stacks with its room. Encrypted rooms render a fixed string;
decryption needs a crypto store the extension can open, which is a later phase.

**Read-state hygiene reaches pushed notifications.** The receipt handler in
`events.rs` already dismissed a room's notifications on any of the own user's
read receipts, from any device — but on iOS `notify::cancel_room` could only
remove what this process posted through the plugin, and a pushed notification's
identifier is assigned by the system in a process that was never ours. The one
handle the app has on those is the `threadIdentifier` the NSE stamps, so
`main.mm` supplies a cleaner that removes delivered notifications by thread id
and `cancel_room` calls both removals; the two sets are disjoint. Read a room
on the device and its stack clears immediately; read it elsewhere and the stack
clears when the receipt reaches this device's sync — on launch or resume for a
suspended app, since nothing here can run before then (see the Signal
comparison: their gateway pushes read-syncs as NSE-waking alerts, which for us
would be a Sygnal patch, deliberately not taken on).

**Taps route through Android's pipeline.** tauri-plugin-notification owns the
`UNUserNotificationCenter` delegate, and its `didReceive` deliberately ignores
push-triggered responses — so `main.mm` hooks that method and takes exactly the
case the plugin declines, the two partitioning on the same trigger check. The
tap is written as the same `PendingNotificationAction` file MainActivity
mirrors on Android, an event nudges a live webview to consume it immediately,
and the boot-time replay covers the cold start — one dispatch path
(`routeNotificationAction`) for both platforms, warm or cold. The extension
stamps `categoryIdentifier = quark_message` on what it renders, which is what
puts the Reply and Mark-as-read actions registered there on a *pushed*
notification; an aps payload names no category, and the app's registration
alone is not enough.

The displaced implementation is parked on the hooked class under a private
selector, not in a global. The delegate property is weak, so more than one
class is reachable over a session — a deallocated plugin manager leaves the
slot empty, the next foreground hooks `main.mm`'s own fallback delegate, and a
later plugin re-registration hooks a third — and a single saved pointer would
have the earlier ones calling a later class's original with a mismatched
`self`. Taking the selector over with `class_addMethod` rather than
`method_setImplementation` matters for the same reason in the other direction:
where the implementation is inherited, replacing it would rewrite the
superclass's method for every subclass of it.

Two things cross into it, and both go through the **app group**
(`group.tel.quark.app`), because an extension cannot read the app's keychain —
the `keyring` crate cannot set a keychain access group. `secrets.rs` writes the
homeserver and access token, marked
`NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication`: the default class would
make the file unreadable while the device is locked, which is precisely when
pushes arrive, so the bug would pass every hand test. It writes the
`show_body` / `show_sender` flags separately and *unprotected*, because the
failure mode of an unreadable flags file has to be showing less rather than
more. Logout deletes the credentials — a token in a shared container outlives
the session otherwise — and keeps the flags, which are a preference.

What the extension cannot do is decline to show a notification. The only
mechanism that can suppress a pushed notification is a server-side push rule
that stops the homeserver sending it — which is what room mutes already use, and
why anything meant to silence a room has to reach the ruleset rather than a
local config the extension never reads.

#### The pusher ledger

`push.json` stores the transport address separately from the registered pusher.
`last.pushkey` is what the homeserver was told; `endpoint` is what the platform
handed us. They diverge whenever registration hasn't caught up — an endpoint
rotated while the app wasn't running — and writing the address down on arrival
is what lets registration happen at the next login instead of dying with the
process that heard about it. Switching push **off** forgets the address rather
than waiting to be told: the opt-out ends by removing the saved distributor, so
the `onUnregistered` callback that would have done it has no route home. A stale
endpoint is worse than none — `should_request_endpoint` reads it as "already
have one" and no later login ever asks the transport again.

**A pusher can outlive everything that knows about it.** It is server-side
state created by an access token, and once no local record names it, nothing can
delete it — the homeserver goes on waking a dead endpoint forever. So
`push.json` is not treated as a mirror of the homeserver but as a ledger of what
is owed:

- Registrations are keyed by `(user_id, app_id, pushkey)`. Only the account that
  created a pusher can replace or delete it, and one install can serve several
  accounts offering the *same* transport address — so without the user id a
  re-login or account switch reads its own address as already registered and
  never registers at all.
- An address is written down as a **pending delete before** the round-trip that
  creates it, and promoted to `last` only once the homeserver acknowledges. The
  window where a pusher exists that nothing remembers is what makes one
  undeletable, and a timeout cannot say which side of it we are on. Deleting a
  pusher that was never created is a no-op, so owing the delete is safe both ways.
- Deletes that can't be performed — offline, or push switched off while logged
  out — stay on the pending list rather than being dropped, and are paid off by
  `retry_pending_deletes` at the next login. Dropping them leaves a gateway
  holding a live address for a user who opted out, with nothing in the UI left to
  act on.
- `logout` unregisters *before* revoking the token, since afterwards there is
  nothing to delete with. `clear_session` can't, so it forgets the records
  instead: they went with the token, and keeping them would convince the next
  login it was already registered.
- Writes are atomic (temp file + rename) and an unreadable `push.json` is moved
  to `push.json.corrupt` rather than overwritten — it may be the only surviving
  record of a live pusher.

A distributor re-announcing the endpoint it already gave us is free only when
a pusher points at it (`push::is_registered_at`). The address is stored before
registration is attempted, so a first attempt that failed leaves it stored
and unregistered; treating that re-announcement as "nothing new" left push
dead until the next app launch, which for a user who only meets the app
through its notifications may never come.

Reads never mint state: `get_push_status` uses `load_push_state`, so opening
Settings on desktop doesn't create a `push.json` for a platform that can never
use one.

### Mobile touch behaviour

**Nothing the user composes on pans the viewport.** With the keyboard up, iOS keeps the layout viewport at full height and lets the visual viewport be panned within it, so any drag the page doesn't consume pans the shell — including drags on a compose bar, which has nothing of its own to scroll (#33). `touch-action` handles the leaves it can, but it cannot express the rule for a region: it intersects down the tree, so `none` on `.input-bar` or the compose box would take the text field's own `pan-y` with it. `guardViewportPan` (`src/app/mobile.ts`) is the enforcement — a non-passive `touchmove` listener on a container that swallows every drag except the one element with something of its own to scroll. Three surfaces carry one, because each is a container the others don't reach into:

| Surface | Guarded element | Let through |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main composer | `.input-bar-wrap` (`Input`) | `.input-bar__field` — it scrolls past six lines — and `.attach-tray__items`, the staged-attachments row, which scrolls sideways |
| Autocomplete popover | `.shortcode-preview` (`ShortcodePreview` / `MentionPreview`, mounted on `.content-area`, so outside the wrap) | itself, but only while the list actually overflows |
| Thread overlay compose row | `.thread-view__input-bar` (`ThreadView` builds its own row; it does not use `Input`) | nothing — the reply field is one line |

Adding chrome inside one of those containers needs no new `touch-action` rule. Adding a *new* compose surface does need its own guard. The guard is attached only while mobile mode is on, so desktop never pays for a blocking touch path, and it stands down while the page is pinch-zoomed, where panning is how the user reaches the rest of the shell.

**Overlays follow the pan.** The shell compensates for the pan with a transform on `#app` (`--viewport-pan`, published by `mobile.ts`). Overlays mount on `<body>` so nothing can clip them, which puts them outside that element — so they mount through `mountOverlay` (`src/ui/overlay.ts`), which tags them with `.quark-overlay` and earns them the same offset. Without it the two shear apart as the pan grows: toasts land off-screen and the emoji picker floats away from the compose bar it is anchored to. The offset uses the individual `translate` property, not `transform`, so it composes with the `translate(-50%, -50%)` that dialogs centre themselves with. The shell and the overlay layer therefore share a coordinate space that client rects do not: an overlay placed off an anchor's `getBoundingClientRect()` must subtract `viewportPan()`, or it lands a pan below its anchor.

**Pinch-zoom is off, but the layout is still zoom-aware.** The viewport meta (`user-scalable=no`, `maximum-scale=1`) disables page zoom — on iOS the meta is the only mechanism, since WebKit does not let `touch-action` suppress its page-level pinch; a body-level `touch-action: pan-x pan-y` covers engines that do honor it. Zoom can still happen regardless: Android's "force enable zoom" accessibility setting overrides the meta, and a ≤768px desktop window can be trackpad-pinched. A pinch shrinks the visual viewport to roughly `layoutHeight / scale`, which from a height difference alone is indistinguishable from an open keyboard — so `viewportMetrics` takes `visualViewport.scale` and claims neither a keyboard inset nor a pan while zoomed, and the compose guards stand down there too. `ImageLightbox` implements its own pinch-to-zoom for images in JS; the meta does not affect it.

**Long press opens the action sheet, and nothing else.** `attachLongPress` (`src/app/long_press.ts`) is the one gesture helper — the timeline, room list and space strip all attach it at their container. It fires only in mobile mode (a desktop-width touchscreen gets `contextmenu` and the floating menu, never the sheet) and swallows the click the engine synthesises after the press. The engine would otherwise start a native text selection on the same press, so in mobile mode the whole message row is `user-select: none`. Copying a fragment goes through the sheet's **Select text** row instead: it opts that one body back in (`.message__body--selectable`), selects its contents and hands it to the platform's own handles and callout (#100). It deliberately does not reuse the vim `o` text-select path, which sets `contenteditable` and would raise the soft keyboard. The opt-in is revoked on the next press elsewhere.

## UI Design

### Interaction parity

Every feature is reachable from the keyboard, from a pointer and by touch. That
is asserted, not aspired to: `src/app/parity.ts` models how each registry action
can be reached and `parity.test.ts` fails a build that leaves one unreachable.
An action that genuinely cannot have a pointer or touch affordance carries a
`parityExempt` reason on its registry entry — navigation, whose pointer
equivalent is clicking the thing itself; the markdown formatting toggles,
which have keyboard chords and the desktop compose menu but no touch path by
the decision recorded in `Input.ts`; and the compose menu's clipboard and draft
rows, which restate what the text field already gives keyboard and touch users.

The model deliberately distinguishes surfaces that exist in only one modality.
The desktop room header is `display: none` on mobile and the timeline's hover
action bar has no hover to respond to, so neither counts as touch reach; the
mobile top bar and its `⋮` menu do not count as pointer reach; the
compose-box menu is desktop-only and does not count as touch reach. The first
four asymmetries are what the v0.20.0 audit found features hiding behind.

Reachability "via the command palette" is tracked separately, because the
palette lists nearly everything and an assertion that accepted it everywhere
would pass vacuously. Actions whose only pointer or touch path is the palette
are pinned as an explicit list, so that set stays a deliberate choice rather
than absorbing every new action nobody got round to giving a home.

All panels, borders, and text use monospace rendering. Colors, borders, and glyph styles are controlled by themes.

### Spaces (Cinny-Style)

The room list has a two-column layout inspired by Cinny:

**Left strip — Space selector:**
- Narrow vertical strip showing space icons (avatar images or first-letter fallback)
- A "Home" icon at the top for rooms not in any space, and a "DMs" icon
- Spaces display their avatar/icon; this is the only place icons appear in the room list
- `j/k` (or rebound keys) to navigate spaces, `Enter` to select
- Selecting a space filters the room list to show only that space's children
- Each space remembers its own last-active chat: switching to a space loads that
  chat into the timeline (or its first room on first visit), so the timeline
  never lingers on a room from the space you just left. Memory is session-only.

**Right column — Room list (text only, no icons):**
- Rooms listed by name in a **fixed, deterministic order** (not sorted by activity):
  - Order follows the `m.space.child` state event `order` field if set
  - Fallback: alphabetical by room name
  - User can pin rooms to top via `:pin` command
- No room avatars or icons — text only, matching the CLI aesthetic
- Unread indicators via color (theme-configurable) and optional badge count.
  Two counters, and they are not interchangeable: the SDK's *notification* count
  is every unread message that fired a push rule and drives the unread state,
  while its *highlight* count is mentions only and drives the numeric badge.
  Both room-list paths and the live-sync payload map them through one
  `RoomUnread` conversion (`matrix/rooms.rs`) because reading them the wrong way
  round is invisible in any room where the two happen to be equal. Counts are
  server-authoritative: `quark://sync/unread_count` applies them as they change,
  so a mention lights the badge without waiting for a room-list refresh and a
  read receipt from another device clears it. The open room is exempt — its
  badge is cleared locally on open and its read receipt sent only then, so the
  server's count for it climbs for as long as the user sits reading
- Muted rooms are marked and excluded from unread highlighting. The flag comes
  from the room's `RoomNotificationMode` (server-side push rules), not the local
  `mute_rooms` list, so a mute set in another client shows up here too — see
  *Push notifications*
- Nested spaces shown as indented sections with collapsible headers
- Categories/sections within a space rendered as visual dividers (using `m.space.child` ordering)

This mirrors Cinny's approach: spaces have visual identity through icons, but the channel list itself is clean text in a stable order, so rooms don't jump around based on activity.

### Vim-Style Navigation

**Modes:**
- **Normal** — navigate rooms, scroll messages, select items
- **Insert** — compose messages in the input bar
- **Command** — `:` prefix for client commands
- **Visual** — select text/messages for quoting or copying

**Key bindings (defaults, all rebindable via quarkrc — see below):**

| Context       | Key           | Action                        |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Global        | `i`           | Enter insert mode             |
| Global        | `Esc`         | Return to normal mode         |
| Global        | `:`           | Open command bar              |
| Global        | `Ctrl-k`      | Open the command palette      |
| Global        | `j` / `↓`     | Select next item              |
| Global        | `k` / `↑`     | Select previous item          |
| Global        | `h` / `←`     | Focus the panel to the left   |
| Global        | `l` / `→`     | Focus the panel to the right  |
| Global        | `gg` / `G`    | Jump to first / last item     |
| Global        | `Enter` / `o` | Open the focused item         |
| Global        | `m`           | Toggle the member list        |
| Global        | `P`           | Open your profile             |
| Global        | `I`           | Open room info                |
| Global        | `S`           | Set your presence status      |
| Global        | `?`           | Open settings                 |
| Timeline      | `r`           | Reply to selected message     |
| Timeline      | `e`           | React to selected message     |
| Timeline      | `t`           | Open/enter thread             |
| Timeline      | `dd`          | Redact own message            |
| Timeline      | `E` / `c`     | Edit own message              |
| Timeline      | `y`           | Copy selected message         |
| Timeline      | `o`           | Select text within the message|
| Timeline      | `p`           | Paste into the compose box    |
| Timeline      | `>`           | Quote selection into compose  |
| Insert        | `Ctrl-e`      | Open emoji/sticker picker     |
| Insert        | `Ctrl-g`      | Open GIF search               |
| Insert        | `Ctrl-b/i/u`  | Bold / italic / underline     |
| Insert        | `Ctrl-Shift-x`| Strikethrough                 |
| Insert        | `Enter`       | Send (see send-key behaviour) |
| Insert        | `:word:`      | Autocomplete :shortcode:      |
| Picker        | `j/k/h/l`     | Navigate grid                 |
| Picker        | `Enter`       | Select emoji/sticker/GIF      |

Modifier chords are ordinary bindings: they resolve atomically rather than
through the multi-key sequence grammar, and `Meta` folds onto `Ctrl` so a macOS
user's Cmd and everyone else's Ctrl are one binding. Only a chord that is
actually bound is claimed, so `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+V`/`Ctrl+A` reach the browser
untouched.

A chord is matched on what it means, not how it was typed: modifier case,
modifier order and the key's own case are all folded, so `ctrl-e`, `Ctrl-E` and
`shift-ctrl-x` all bind the chords you would expect. Plain sequences stay
case-sensitive — `G` and `g` are different keys.

**Compose box ↔ timeline:** with a draft in the compose box, `Esc` drops into
Normal-mode editing of the draft (vim motions/operators on the text). The
compose box then behaves like the message just below the timeline — pressing the
up key (`k`) on the draft's first line moves focus up into the timeline, and the
down key (`j`) past the last message drops back into the draft (caret at the
top). `i` resumes editing. An empty compose box is left untouched by `j` at the
bottom of the timeline; press `i` to start composing.

### Keybinding Configuration (quarkrc)

Keybindings are configured via `~/.config/quark/quarkrc`, using a vimrc-inspired syntax. This file is sourced on startup and on `:source` command.

```vim
" ~/.config/quark/quarkrc

" Remap navigation to ijkl (scandalous but valid)
nmap i     mode-insert
nmap j     nav-left
nmap k     nav-down
nmap l     nav-up        " yes, really
nmap ;     nav-right

" Context-scoped mappings
tmap k     scroll-down          " timeline: scroll down
tmap l     scroll-up            " timeline: scroll up
rmap k     room-next            " room list: next room
rmap l     room-prev            " room list: prev room
pmap k     picker-down          " picker: move down
pmap l     picker-up            " picker: move up
pmap j     picker-left          " picker: move left
pmap ;     picker-right         " picker: move right

" Multi-key sequences
nmap gg    jump-top
nmap G     jump-bottom
nmap dd    redact

" Leader key (default: space)
let mapleader = " "
nmap <leader>e  emoji-picker
nmap <leader>g  gif-search
nmap <leader>s  sticker-picker
nmap <leader>t  thread-open
nmap <leader>v  verify-device

" Unmap a default binding
nunmap gs

" Set options (like :set in vim)
set scrolloff=5               " keep 5 messages visible above/below cursor
set shortcode_preview=true    " show emoji preview while typing :shortcode:
set gif_provider=klipy        " klipy | giphy
set gif_rating=pg             " g | pg | pg-13 | r
set home_dm_limit=12          " chats shown on the Home canvas
```

**Map command syntax:**
- `nmap` — normal mode mapping
- `imap` — insert mode mapping
- `tmap` — timeline-scoped mapping (normal mode, timeline focused)
- `rmap` — room list-scoped mapping (normal mode, room list focused)
- `pmap` — picker-scoped mapping (emoji/sticker/GIF picker)
- `cmap` — command mode mapping
- `vmap` — visual mode mapping
- `nunmap`, `iunmap`, etc. — remove a mapping
- `noremap` variants (`nnoremap`, etc.) — non-recursive mappings

Scoped maps (`tmap`, `rmap`, `pmap`) take precedence over global `nmap` when that panel is focused. This allows the same key to do different things depending on context.

**quarkrc also supports:**
- `source <path>` — include another rc file
- `colorscheme <name>` — the theme to start in, unless `config.toml` names one (see [Theme precedence](#theme-precedence))
- `set <option>=<value>` — set config options inline
- `" comments` — lines starting with `"` are ignored
- `autocmd` — hooks for events (e.g., `autocmd RoomEnter * set scrolloff=3`)

**Map-type support.** `nmap` (normal/global), `tmap` (timeline), `rmap` (room
list), `pmap` (pickers and dialogs), `imap` (insert mode) and `vmap` (visual
mode) all resolve. `cmap` does not: the command bar is a text field that owns
its structural keys (Enter, Tab, history) and has no action vocabulary to bind
against, so a `cmap` directive is reported and ignored rather than silently
dropped. `imap` and `vmap` were in that same silently-dropped state until
v0.20.0 — accepted, registered, and never consulted.

### Commands

Commands, keybindings, menu rows and the command palette all read from one
table: `src/app/registry.ts`. Before it, the same action was described in four
places that drifted apart — tab completion, the executor's switch, this
document, and the inline context-menu literals — so `:room-settings` executed
but never completed, and the help dialog advertised commands that did not exist
while omitting fourteen that did. Adding a command to the registry without a
handler is now a compile error, not a silent no-op.

Arguments follow one grammar: `<required>` and `[optional]`. The command palette
reads it to decide whether a row can run outright or must prefill the command
bar for the user to finish — a palette row cannot supply `@user:server`.

**The command palette** (`Ctrl+K`, the search (magnifier) button in the space strip, or a
pull-down from the top of the open drawer on mobile) searches rooms and actions
together. A leading `:` drops the rooms. A row that needs an argument prefills
the command bar; a row whose action is irreversible goes through the same
confirmation the menus use, so fuzzy-matching onto `:leave` cannot leave a room
on one keystroke. It exists because `commandBar.show()`
is reachable only through the `mode-command` action, which requires vim mode —
and vim mode is force-disabled on mobile, so without the palette no `:` command
could be run on a phone at all.

A room's `m.direct` flag is the sole test for whether it appears under the
**Direct Messages** pseudo-space rather than **Group Rooms** — member count does
not override it. Bridged DMs routinely carry a relay bot beside the two humans,
and `:converttodm` exists so the user can declare a room a DM regardless of who
else is in it. The flag is account data, so it needs no power level and works in
rooms you do not moderate.

**Opening a DM with someone** — the `[message]` button in the profile view, and
anything else that reaches `openOrCreateDm` — resolves the existing room from
the account's `m.direct` mapping in the backend (`find_dm_room`, a local store
read; no HTTP). Only when that returns nothing is a room created. The
authoritative lookup matters because the alternative, scanning the cached room
list for small `is_direct` rooms and fetching each one's members to confirm,
misses a DM whose other party has left, one that is still an unaccepted invite,
and one sync has not surfaced yet — and every miss creates a *second* DM with
the same person. The SDK deliberately keeps a departed member in the room's
`dm_targets` for exactly this reason. Where several rooms match, a joined room
beats an invite and the most recently active wins. A failed lookup is reported,
never treated as "no DM exists".

When the resolved room is a pending invite, opening it accepts the invite
first. `get_rooms` enumerates joined rooms alone, so no room-list refresh can
ever surface an invite — without the join, the room opens with no `RoomInfo`
behind it (a raw room ID for a name, no topic, member count or encryption
state) and its timeline is requested for a room the account is not in. The user
asked to message this person and the invite is that same DM, so accepting it is
what the action means.

### Context Menus

Right-click (desktop) or long-press (touch) opens Quark's own menu in place of the browser's. Every menu wears the same chrome, deliberately: a menu must read as **menu chrome**, not as the thing it was summoned from, so it stays squared off and keeps a plain `--border-color` edge rather than the compose box's accent-tinted one.

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ COMPOSE                  esc │  header bar    — --surface-subtle, accent title
├──────────────────────────────┤
│ FORMAT                       │  section strip — --surface-dim, hairline both sides
│ [B][I][U][S][‖][`]           │  chip row      — formatting toggles
│ CLIPBOARD                    │
│ Cut                   Ctrl-x │  item row      — label + shortcut hint
│ Copy                  Ctrl-c │
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Contents come from the registry.** Each row is an entry's `menus` facet in `src/app/registry.ts`: label, group, order, and the presentation flags below. `buildMenu` (`src/app/context_menus.ts`) sorts rows by (group, order) and draws a **section header** above each group on surfaces that name their groups (`MENU_SECTIONS`: the message and compose menus), a plain rule between groups elsewhere. Callers pass only behaviour, keyed by action id; an id with no handler is dropped, which is how rows that depend on the target — "Mark as read", the selection rows — come and go. A row can be:

- **greyed rather than omitted** (`whenUnavailable: "disable"`) when its absence would read as a missing feature — Edit and Delete on someone else's message. A caller can also grey a row for the moment (Cut with nothing selected).
- **destructive** (`danger`), drawn in `--accent-error`.
- **a chip** (`chip: "B"`): rows in the same group collect into one row of toggles, and the label becomes the tooltip. Chips leave the menu open — formatting is applied more than once per visit.

Keys: `j`/`k` (or ↑/↓) move between rows, `h`/`l` (or ←/→) move within the chip row, `Enter`/`Space` activates, `Esc` dismisses and returns the caret to wherever it was. Dismissing never runs anything.

**The hint column is the live keymap, and it is live in the menu too.** A row's hint is the action's current binding, so a quarkrc remap shows up in the menu. An open menu holds focus and the app's global keys are suspended while it does, so the menu honours its own hints: right-click a message and press `E` and you get the editor, the same as with the menu closed. Hints are read in keymap syntax — a single character (`E`, `@`, case-sensitive), a chord (`Ctrl-x`, `Ctrl-Shift-v`, folded the way the keymap folds them, Cmd included), or a run of letters (`dd`, which waits for the whole sequence and is abandoned if you navigate instead). Actions the keymap doesn't own — the text field's clipboard keys — carry a fixed `hint` in the registry instead. A hint that names no keystroke (`↗`, the system browser) is documentation. A greyed row still claims its key, so `E` on someone else's message does nothing rather than leaking through.

**Compose menu** — right-click inside the compose box. The only place formatting appears: you are editing text you own.

| Group | Entries |
|-------|---------|
| `format` | B / I / U / S / ‖ / ` — one toggle per markdown marker, shown only with a selection. A toggle renders lit when its marker is already applied and strips it on the next press; the `format-*` bindings (`Ctrl-b`/`i`/`u`, `Ctrl-Shift-x`) route through the same toggle. |
| `clipboard` | Cut, Copy (greyed without a selection), Paste, Paste as plain text. **Paste** does what `Ctrl+V` does — files a file manager copied, then a clipboard image, each staged in the attachment tray, then text. **Paste as plain text** always inserts the text flavour, with markdown metacharacters escaped so it arrives literally. |
| `selection` | Search web for "…" (system browser, DuckDuckGo), Copy as quote (`> `-prefixed, to the clipboard). Shown only with a selection. |
| `insert` | Emoji…, GIF…, Attach file…, Mention… (types `@` and opens the member autocomplete). |
| `draft` | Undo — steps back through compose history; typed runs coalesce into one step, and the history is dropped on room switch so it can't resurrect another room's draft. Discard draft — clears the text, staged attachments, and a pending edit or reply; one Undo brings the text back. |

**Message menu** — right-click, long-press, or the hover bar's ⋯. Same shell, no formatting: you are not editing text here.

| Group | Entries |
|-------|---------|
| `respond` | Reply, React, Thread |
| `clipboard` | Copy message text, Copy as quote, Select text (mobile only) |
| `selection` | Search web for "…", Copy selected text — shown only when text is highlighted **inside that message** |
| `event` | View raw event, Edit, Delete — Edit and Delete are greyed on someone else's message |

The room-list, space-strip, section and overflow menus use the same shell with a header and plain separators.

On touch the menu redocks as a **bottom sheet**: full-width, docked to the viewport edge, 44px rows, sticky header, shortcut hints hidden. Inside the compose field, touch keeps the platform's native selection callout instead — the OS long-press UI is what users expect there — which is why the compose surface counts as pointer reach but not touch reach in the parity model.

### Room Dialog

One tabbed dialog covers everything about a room: **Info** (read-only facts,
mute, raw state, leave), **Settings** (name, topic, conversation type, access),
**Members** (invite, and kick/ban where your power level permits) and
**Permissions** (power levels). `:info` and `:roomsettings` are two doors into
it; on mobile it shows the tab list first, like the settings dialog.

It replaces a pair of dialogs that both stated name, topic, members, encryption
and directness while only one could change any of it — and that kept mute, leave
and raw state on the info side alone, which the mobile layout hid entirely.

Moderation controls render against the account's own power level rather than
unconditionally. Matrix requires strictly greater power to kick or ban and never
permits acting on yourself, so a room where everyone sits at the default offers
nothing — a button the homeserver will refuse is worse than no button, because
the user cannot tell a permission problem from a bug.

### Settings Dialog

Opened via `:settings` or the settings UI affordance. The dialog has eight tabs, rendered in this order:

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| **General** | Theme selector, notification toggles, send-key behaviour, read-receipt toggles, confirm-redact toggle |
| **Account** | Devices & Verification — see below |
| **Media** | Image auto-load, max dimensions, cache-size limit |
| **GIF** | Provider (Klipy / Giphy), API key, content rating |
| **Emoji** | Shortcode autocomplete toggle, minimum-character threshold |
| **Notifications** | Enable / preview / sender toggles, push and background-sync controls, test notification |
| **Themes** | Theme picker and hot-reload path |
| **About** | App version, Quark on GitHub link, Updates section (desktop only — see below) |

The tab strip never scrolls horizontally; long option text is constrained within each tab's panel.

#### Account tab — Devices & Verification

- **Session list** — all devices registered on the account, each showing: display name, last-seen timestamp + IP address, and a trust badge (verified / unverified / unknown).
- **Rename device** — edit the display name of your current device or any other session.
- **Remove session** — delete another device; requires password re-authentication (UIAA).
- **Verify another user** — enter a `@user:server` Matrix ID to initiate SAS emoji verification with that user's device.
- **Reset cross-signing** — regenerates cross-signing keys; requires password re-authentication (UIAA).
- **Key backup status** — read-only line showing whether backup is enabled and whether a backup exists on the server (`Backup: enabled/disabled · on server: yes/no`). Enabling or restoring key backup from the settings UI is not yet supported.
- **Prompt to verify on startup** — toggle (moved here from General).
- **Log out** — ends the current session and returns to the login screen.

#### About tab

Shows the running app version, a "Quark on GitHub" link (opens in the system browser), and the **Updates** section. The Updates section (release channel dropdown + auto-check toggle) is shown on **desktop only**; it is hidden on mobile, where in-app updates are not supported.

## Matrix Feature Support

### Core Protocol
- [x] Login: OIDC (MAS) + legacy password + SSO
- [x] Sync: classic v3 `/sync` — long-poll against a server-side filter, resumed from a persisted `since` cursor
- [ ] Sliding Sync (MSC4186) — **not implemented.** matrix-sdk 0.9 does not compile in its sliding-sync support
      (`experimental-sliding-sync` is not in its default features) and nothing in the backend uses it. Adopting it
      needs the matrix-sdk 0.9 → 0.18 upgrade first, where sliding sync is no longer feature-gated at all. No issue
      tracks that upgrade yet; #57 (iOS push Phase 4) only records that it should be *decided* before the NSE work
      builds on the current API. The upgrade does not itself require sliding sync — 0.18 still exposes `sync`,
      `sync_once` and `sync_with_callback`, so the v3 loop survives it and the two are separable pieces of work.
- [x] E2EE: Megolm via Vodozemac, cross-signing, key backup (SSSS)
- [x] Device verification: SAS emoji, QR code
- [x] Room creation, join, leave, invite, kick, ban
- [x] Room directory & federated room search
- [x] In-room message search — header search box (`:search`) with four tiers: loaded window (instant) · local cache (matrix-sdk event cache, offline) · back-to-date · entire history. Server tiers stream results one page at a time (bounded memory) and are cancelable.
- [x] Spaces: hierarchy display, space-scoped room lists, restricted joins
- [x] Threads (m.thread relation) — replies carry media and MSC2530 captions,
      converted by the same code path as the main timeline
- [x] Rich replies (m.in_reply_to) — every reply gets its banner, even when the
      original is outside the loaded window: the preview is looked up in the
      page, then the whole buffer, then a cache of fetched originals, and
      otherwise drawn as "loading original message…" while `get_event` fetches
      it (at most four at once; "original message unavailable" if it is gone).
      An undecryptable reply keeps its banner, since `m.relates_to` is
      cleartext; a thread's `is_falling_back` pointer is not a reply. Clicking
      the banner jumps to the original — scrolling if loaded, else loading its
      context, else opening its thread if it is a thread reply
- [x] Reactions (m.annotation) — Unicode + custom emoji
- [x] Message editing & redaction — an edit re-runs the outgoing formatter, so
      `m.new_content` keeps the HTML `formatted_body` and custom emoji survive
      the edit instead of degrading to literal `:shortcode:` text
- [x] Read receipts (public m.read + private m.read.private) — displayed Element-style as shifting, overlapping avatars at the bottom-right of each other user's last-read message (seeded on room open via `get_room_receipts`, updated live). Settings toggles: "send my read receipts" (private-only when off) and "show others' read receipts".
- [x] Typing indicators
- [x] Presence (when homeserver enables it)
- [x] Authenticated media (MSC3916)
- [x] Room summary previews (MSC3266)

### Custom Emoji & Stickers (MSC2545 — im.ponies)

Full compatibility with Cinny, FluffyChat, Nheko, and SchildiChat.

**Pack sources:**
- `im.ponies.room_emotes` — room state events (per-room packs)
- `im.ponies.user_emotes` — account data (personal packs)
- Packs distinguish emoji (`usage: ["emoticon"]`) from stickers (`usage: ["sticker"]`)

**Sending custom emoji in messages:**
- User types `:shortcode:` → autocomplete resolves from available packs
- Sent as `formatted_body` HTML: `<img data-mx-emoticon height="32" src="mxc://..." alt=":shortcode:" title=":shortcode:" />`
- Plain `body` contains `:shortcode:` as fallback
- Format field: `org.matrix.custom.html`

**Sending stickers:**
- Sticker picker (keyboard-navigable grid) sourced from packs with `usage: ["sticker"]`
- Sent as `m.sticker` event with `url` (mxc://), `body`, and `info` (mimetype, dimensions, thumbnail)
- Rendered in timeline at larger size than emoji, standalone (not inline with text)

**Custom emoji in reactions:**
- Reaction key is `:shortcode:`
- Client resolves the mxc:// URL from loaded packs for display
- Falls back to text `:shortcode:` if pack not available

**Custom emoji in replies:**
- Reply preview renders custom emoji images inline
- `<mx-reply>` fallback contains `:shortcode:` text

**Pack management UI:**
- View available packs (room + personal)
- Create/edit personal packs (set state on account data)
- Create/edit room packs (if user has state event permissions)
- Import packs from other rooms

### GIF Search

Discord-style integrated GIF search, accessible from insert mode or command bar.

**Providers (configurable in quarkrc):**
- Klipy (default) — `set gif_provider=klipy`
- Giphy — `set gif_provider=giphy`
- Content rating filter: `set gif_rating=pg` (g / pg / pg-13 / r)

**UX flow:**
1. User presses `Ctrl-g` (insert mode) or runs `:gif <query>`
2. A search overlay appears with a text input and a grid of GIF thumbnails
3. Thumbnails are animated previews (low-res for performance)
4. Navigate grid with `j/k/h/l`, search with `/`, send with `Enter`
5. `Tab` to load more results, `Esc` to dismiss
6. Selected GIF is uploaded to the homeserver as media and sent as an `m.image` event with `info.mimetype: "image/gif"` — this avoids linking to external URLs that may break or track users

**Backend:**
- Rust backend handles API calls to Klipy/Giphy (API keys stored in config)
- Downloads selected GIF, uploads to homeserver via media API
- Caches recent search results and thumbnails locally

### Emoji Shortcode Preview

When the user types `:` followed by characters in insert mode, an inline autocomplete popup appears:

```
:> I think this is :aweso|
  ┌──────────────────────────┐
  │ 😎  :awesome:            │  ← Unicode emoji
  │ [img] :awesome_face:     │  ← Custom emoji (shows image)
  │ 🌟  :awesome_star:       │
  └──────────────────────────┘
```

- Each row shows the emoji **image or glyph** alongside the `:shortcode:`
- Custom emoji display their actual `mxc://` image thumbnail (small, inline)
- Unicode emoji display the native glyph
- List updates as user types, fuzzy-matched against all available packs
- `Tab` / arrow keys to select, `Enter` to insert, `Esc` to dismiss
- Triggered after `shortcode_min_chars` characters (default: 2, configurable via `set shortcode_min_chars=2` in quarkrc)
- Sources: Unicode emoji database + `im.ponies.user_emotes` + `im.ponies.room_emotes` from current room

### Links

Every anchor a message can produce — auto-linkified plain text, an `<a>` in a
sanitised `formatted_body`, the same in a thread reply or after an edit — is
styled and activated by one shared path (`src/app/links.ts`), so a markdown link
whose label is not itself a URL looks and behaves like every other link.

On the sending side, the compose box's inline markdown (`src/app/markdown.ts`)
turns `[label](url)` into `<a href>` in the `formatted_body`, leaving the
markdown source in `body` as the plain fallback. Only `http(s)`, `mailto` and
`matrix` targets link; anything else stays literal text. Whenever a message has
a `formatted_body`, its newlines go out as `<br>`, because other clients render
that HTML normally and a bare newline would collapse to a space.

Activation is a **single capture-phase guard on the document**, not a listener
per anchor. Left click and middle click both open the URL in the system browser
and cancel the in-window navigation; middle-click `mousedown` is cancelled too,
since the engine starts navigating (and autoscroll) before `auxclick` fires.
Modifiers are ignored on purpose: "open in a new tab" means nothing in a
single-window WebView, so every activation lands in the same place. Anchors with
`download`, and any non-http(s) href, are left alone. Only the mobile WebView
gets `target="_blank"` — on desktop it makes wry open the URL itself, which
alongside `openExternalUrl` opened every link twice.

### Media Handling
- Authenticated media download via `/_matrix/client/v1/media/download/`
- Inline image previews in timeline (configurable max dimensions)
- **Staged attachments & captions (MSC2530):** every attachment — picked via
  the attach button, pasted or dropped; image, video or any other file — waits
  in a tray above the compose bar rather than sending immediately
  (`src/ui/AttachmentTray.ts`, owned by `Input`). Images show as thumbnails,
  everything else as a one-line chip (a glyph, the filename and a human size),
  each with its own `×`. Adding more files appends them, in order. The tray's
  row scrolls sideways rather than wrapping, so a long batch never pushes the
  compose bar off a phone screen, and mobile uses the same tray. Nothing is
  sent until the composer is submitted (Enter, the ➤ button or the tray's
  Send button). Then every staged attachment goes out in order, sequentially,
  as `m.image`, `m.video` or `m.file` by type (`attachmentKind`). Any typed
  text becomes the **first** attachment's caption, whatever its type — MSC2530
  allows a caption on any media message, and `send_file` / `send_video` take
  one just as `send_pasted_image` does. A captioned upload sends
  `body` = caption and `filename` = original name; with no caption, `body` =
  filename and `filename` is omitted. The read path extracts captions from
  `m.image`, `m.video`, `m.file` and `m.audio` alike, and every timeline
  surface draws one beneath the media. It surfaces `filename` alongside the
  caption rather than making `body` serve both: with a caption present `body`
  *is* the caption, so using it as alt text announced a captioned image twice
  (once as alt, once as the caption drawn beneath it) and labelled a captioned
  video with the caption instead of the file it plays. Alt text, the video
  label and the download name all take the filename, falling back to the
  reply-fallback-stripped body for uploads that carry none. The first `Esc`
  (or the tray's Cancel) clears the whole tray (modal-close semantics — mode,
  reply, and edit state untouched). The room, open thread and armed reply are
  read once, at submit, so the whole batch goes where it was sent even if the
  user moves on while it uploads. Every attachment follows the thread; an
  armed reply rides on the first attachment only and clears once that one is
  sent. A failed (or cancelled) attachment does not stop the rest. The failures go back to the
  front of the tray in order, and if the captioned first attachment is among
  them, so is the caption as typed. Committing an inline edit takes precedence
  — the tray stays pending. Staged attachments persist across room switches
  like text drafts and send to the room current at submit. A caption goes
  through the same emoji expansion as a typed message — Unicode shortcodes
  become glyphs in `body`, custom (MSC2545) ones become
  `<img data-mx-emoticon>` in `formatted_body` with the shortcode left in
  `body` as the fallback — and the read path renders `formatted_body` where
  the event carries one.
- **Attachments follow the open thread.** An image, file, video, sticker or GIF
  sent with a thread open carries that thread's relation, exactly as a text
  reply does. A reply armed *inside* a thread produces one threaded reply
  (`m.thread` carrying the replied-to event), not a reply alongside a thread —
  `m.relates_to` holds one relation, so the two cannot both be set. A reply
  armed *outside* the open thread is not carried: opening a thread disarms the
  reply (the thread banner replaces the reply banner, so one left armed is armed
  invisibly), and an attachment only folds in a reply to the thread's root or to
  one of its replies. Files sent into a thread render in the panel as the same
  click-to-open affordance the main timeline gives them. Attachments
  sent into a thread have no optimistic row: they appear once sent, from the
  send's own echo (see *Attachment progress*), which the live render path
  routes into the panel with its media just as it would the sync echo. Stickers
  and GIFs sent into a thread still wait for the sync echo. An armed reply is
  consumed by the attachment and cleared, as it is for a text message.
- **One attachment route.** The attach button (which accepts several files),
  a paste and a drop onto the window all hand their files to one routine,
  `attachFiles` (`src/app/actions/media.ts`). It stages every file in the tray,
  in order, and switches to Insert mode for the caption. A file the webview
  could not type (`""` or `application/octet-stream`) is sniffed by its leading
  bytes (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, TIFF, ICO, AVIF, HEIC). An image in a format
  WebKitGTK does not name therefore still stages and sends as an image instead
  of uploading as a nameless file.
- **Pasting.** Every file on the clipboard pastes into the composer, not just
  images and not just the first. A clipboard file the engine hands back
  untyped keeps its clipboard target's type. Where the webview exposes a pasted
  image only through the async Clipboard API (Linux/WebKitGTK), the default text
  paste has already run by the time the image arrives. The text it inserted is
  taken back out only when it reads as the image's stand-in (a lone URL, path
  or image filename). Prose that merely shares the clipboard with an image
  stays, and becomes the first attachment's caption. The async Clipboard API is spec-limited to
  `image/png`, so it cannot recover other formats.
- **Pasting files copied in a file manager.** Copying files in Dolphin or
  Nautilus puts a list of `file://` URIs on the clipboard (`text/uri-list`, and
  `x-special/gnome-copied-files` on GNOME), not the files. WebKitGTK shows the
  page only the list's text, and the page cannot open a path, so the backend
  reads the list off the OS clipboard itself: `read_clipboard_files`
  (`src-tauri/src/clipboard_files.rs`). The command takes no argument. It opens
  only what the OS clipboard lists, so nothing the webview sends can point it
  at a file. On Wayland it reads over the data-control protocol
  (`wl-clipboard-rs`), which needs no keyboard focus. Where the compositor
  lacks that protocol (Mutter), or on X11, it reads the X selection
  (`x11-clipboard`), which XWayland mirrors from the Wayland clipboard. Both
  crates are pure Rust, so the build needs no system library. The list is
  parsed here, not by a clipboard crate: entries end in `\r\n` (RFC 2483, and
  what Qt and GTK write), `#` lines are comments, URIs are percent-decoded, and
  `file://localhost/` is local. A non-`file:` URI (a copy out of `smb://`), a
  file on another host, a folder, an unreadable file, or a file past the 100 MB
  per-paste cap is reported by name and skipped, and the rest still attach. The
  composer asks for the list in three cases:
  - The paste's text is nothing but `file:` URIs. The default paste is
    suppressed, because nobody means to send that as a message. If the OS
    clipboard turns out to hold no file list (a URI copied out of a terminal),
    the text is inserted by hand instead.
  - The text is absolute paths, one per line (Nautilus's plain-text flavour).
    A path copied from a terminal looks the same, so the paste goes ahead and
    is taken back out only if a file list is really there.
  - The engine exposed nothing at all.

  Any other text paste never reaches the backend. Linux only; the command
  returns nothing elsewhere. A page can write a URI list to the clipboard
  itself (a `copy` handler's `setData`), so "only what the clipboard lists"
  would otherwise let script in the webview name the files it reads back. Two
  checks close that, each enough on its own. The read is refused while Quark's
  own process owns the selection (GDK's `selection_owner_get`, which answers on
  both its X11 and Wayland backends). It is also refused when the selection
  carries `org.webkitgtk.WebKit.custom-pasteboard-data`, the type WebKit adds to
  everything a page writes and no file manager offers. The second check still
  holds if a clipboard manager takes over a page's list after Quark lets go of
  it. A refused read behaves like a clipboard with no file list: the text
  pastes as text.
- **Dropping.** Files dropped anywhere on the window attach to the open room.
  The composer shows a dashed accent border while a drag is over the window.
  Tauri keeps OS drops for itself (`dragDropEnabled`, left at its default), so
  the webview never sees an HTML5 `drop` carrying a `File`. `src/app/file_drop.ts`
  listens to the native event instead, which delivers paths, and reads each one
  through `read_dropped_file`. That command reads only the exact paths the
  backend recorded from the window's own `DragDropEvent::Drop`
  (`DroppedFiles` in `src-tauri/src/local_files.rs`), so the set is exactly the
  files the user handed over. The asset-protocol scope is not used for this:
  it also allows `$TEMP/**` for serving media, which would let the page read
  any temp file. A dropped folder, or a path
  that can't be read, is reported and skipped, and the rest of the drop still
  attaches. With no room open, a drop says so and reads nothing. Mobile builds
  get no native drop events.
- **Encrypted attachments.** In an encrypted room the bytes are encrypted
  before upload and the event references them as an `m.file` source carrying the
  key, never a plaintext `mxc://`. The room decides this, not the call site:
  the upload takes the `Room` and asks `is_encrypted()` itself, so no send path
  can skip the question, and a room whose state cannot be read is treated as
  encrypted. Applies to images (pasted and picked), files, videos and GIFs.
  Stickers are exempt — they reference media from an existing MSC2545 pack
  rather than uploading anything, so that media is already public.
- **Attachment progress.** Attaching is several phases the user cannot see —
  reading the picked file's bytes, handing them across IPC, then the upload
  itself — and on Android a multi-megabyte pick spends long enough in the first
  two to look like a hang. An inline row above the compose bar names the file
  and reports each phase, showing a real byte percentage where one exists
  (matrix-sdk's upload progress observable) and an honest indeterminate spinner
  where none does, rather than inventing a number. A failure replaces the
  spinner with the backend's message and stays until dismissed; cancel is
  offered only during the local read, the one phase that can still be abandoned
  without something having already been sent.

  When the row ticks, the attachment is already on screen. `send_pasted_image`,
  `send_file` and `send_video` return the sent event alongside its id
  (`SentMessage.echo`), converted by the same function the sync handler uses,
  and the frontend paints it through the same render path sync events take
  (`actions/live.ts`), which deduplicates the sync echo by event id when it
  follows. Attachments used to wait for that echo alone — the one send path
  with no local echo — so on Android, where picking the file backgrounds the
  app and the sync loop comes back from that mid long-poll or asleep in
  backoff, a sent image could stay missing until the room was reopened (#112).

  Rows are scoped to the room the attachment is going to. The composer is
  shared by every room, so an unscoped row followed the user out — a failed
  upload parked its error in whichever room came next, and a success tick
  landed in the wrong one. Switching away hides the row rather than removing
  it: the upload keeps running, and the row (an unread error included) is still
  there on the way back.

  Only phase changes and terminal states are announced to a screen reader, from
  a dedicated live region beside the stack rather than the stack itself. The
  row's status text is rewritten on every progress tick — up to ~100 times per
  upload — so a live region over the rows read the whole bar out again and
  again instead of the few transitions that carry information. The region sits
  outside the hideable stack because one that is `display: none` while idle
  announces nothing when it returns.
- **Thread media (MSC2530 in threads).** The thread timeline is built by the
  same converter as the main timeline, so a reply carrying an image, video,
  sticker or file arrives with its media fields and caption intact. It was
  previously assembled by a separate hand-rolled converter that hardcoded
  `m.text` and dropped every media field, which is why media in a thread used to
  render as a bare filename line.
- Hovering a message reveals the exact send time (HH:MM:SS) in the action bar;
  its tooltip (and the header timestamps') shows the full localized date
- Inline video playback — `m.video` plays inline and seekable: a loopback HTTP server (Range requests) on Linux/WebKitGTK, the asset protocol on macOS/Windows/iOS; graceful fallback to the external player on decode failure
- Sticker rendering (larger than emoji, centered)
- Image uploads with thumbnail generation
- Blurhash placeholders during loading
- Media cache on disk with configurable size limit

### Not in Scope (v1)
- VoIP / MatrixRTC (group calls) — fundamentally incompatible with CLI aesthetic
- Widgets — no iframe support in terminal-styled UI

## Theming

Themes are TOML files stored in `~/.config/quark/themes/`. The active theme is set in `~/.config/quark/config.toml`.

### Built-in Themes
- **Phosphor** — green-on-black CRT terminal
- **Amber** — amber phosphor CRT
- **Dracula** — based on Dracula color scheme
- **Nord** — based on Nord palette
- **Solarized Dark / Light**
- **Catppuccin Mocha / Latte**
- **Gruvbox Dark**
- **High Contrast** — accessibility-focused

### Theme Hot-Reloading
Themes reload on file save (watched via `notify` crate / filesystem events passed through Tauri). No restart required.

### Theme precedence

Two places name a theme at startup. They are applied in this order, and the later one wins:

1. **`quarkrc`'s `colorscheme <name>`** — the theme to start in.
2. **`config.toml`'s `[general] theme`** — the active theme. This is what Settings → Themes writes, and what `colorscheme` yields to: a theme picked in the UI has to survive a relaunch, and the UI does not edit `quarkrc`.

`colorscheme` therefore applies only while `config.toml` leaves `theme` at its default (`"phosphor"`) — i.e. until the user picks one in Settings. After that the rc directive is ignored, and the reason is logged to the console as `[quarkrc] colorscheme … ignored`.

`:theme <name>` applies a theme for the session only; it does not persist.

One known gap: because `"phosphor"` doubles as "no theme chosen", explicitly picking Phosphor in Settings while `quarkrc` names another theme still loses to the rc file on the next launch. Closing it needs `theme` to gain a real unset state.

`quarkrc`'s `set theme=<name>` is a different thing again — it *writes* `config.toml`, so it re-applies on every launch and does override the Settings picker. Use `colorscheme` unless that is what you want.

## Configuration

`~/.config/quark/config.toml`:

```toml
[general]
theme = "phosphor"            # the active theme; outranks quarkrc's `colorscheme`
                              # (see Theme precedence below)
notifications = true
confirm_redact = true
send_key_behavior = "auto"    # auto | enter | newline — what the Enter key does
                              #   auto:    send on desktop, newline on mobile
                              #   enter:   always send (Shift+Enter inserts a newline)
                              #   newline: always newline (send via button / Ctrl·Cmd+Enter)
                              # A dedicated send button appears on mobile, or whenever
                              # Enter won't send. Also: `:set send_key_behavior=…` and
                              # Settings → General → Input.

[sync]
timeline_limit = 50           # initial messages to load per room

[media]
auto_load_images = true
max_image_width = 600
max_image_height = 400
sticker_max_size = 256
cache_size_mb = 500

[gif]
provider = "klipy"            # klipy | giphy
api_key = ""                  # user provides their own API key
rating = "pg"                 # g | pg | pg-13 | r
cache_results = true

[emoji]
shortcode_autocomplete = true
autocomplete_min_chars = 2    # chars before autocomplete triggers

[home]
dm_limit = 12                 # chats shown on the Home canvas

[cache]
image_memory_mb = 150         # in-memory cap for decoded message images
timeline_rooms = 30           # rooms kept in memory for instant re-open

[updater]
channel = "stable"            # stable | beta — which release channel to follow
auto_check = true             # check for an update shortly after sync starts

# Keybindings are configured in ~/.config/quark/quarkrc (see Keybinding Configuration)
# NOT in this file — quarkrc uses vimrc-style syntax for full flexibility
```

---

## Auto-update

Desktop builds update themselves in-app over two release channels:

- **stable** — final tags only (`vX.Y.Z`).
- **beta** — early releases (`vX.Y.Z-beta.N`) *and* every stable release.

A release feeds the channels by tag shape: a final tag (`v1.2.3`) publishes to **both** stable and beta; a pre-release (`v1.2.3-beta.4`) publishes to **beta only**. Each channel is a static manifest served from the project site:

```
https://quark.tel/updates/stable/latest.json
https://quark.tel/updates/beta/latest.json
```

The manifest follows Tauri's static-update schema (`version`, `pub_date`, and a `platforms` map of `{ signature, url }` keyed by target triple). Update payloads are signed with a minisign key; the public key is embedded in the app, so a tampered or unsigned bundle is rejected.

### UX — notify and confirm

Quark never installs silently. When `auto_check` is on, it checks the configured channel a few seconds after sync starts; `:update` runs the same check on demand. If an update is available, a non-modal banner offers **Install & restart** (downloads, installs, and relaunches) or **Later** (dismisses — the same version won't re-nag until you run `:update` again). A failed download leaves the offer in place so it can be retried.

### Configuration

The `[updater]` section (above) holds the prefs; both are also editable live:

- `:set update_channel=stable|beta`
- `:set auto_update=true|false`
- Settings → About → **Updates** (channel dropdown + auto-check toggle; desktop only — hidden on mobile).

### Platform scope

In-app update covers the **AppImage** (Linux x86_64), the **`.app`** (macOS Apple-Silicon / `aarch64` only), and the **NSIS `-setup.exe`** (Windows x86_64). `.deb`/`.rpm`/Flatpak/Android builds update through their own package channels, not this updater. macOS auto-update is best-effort until Apple notarization is configured (Gatekeeper may still warn on a freshly downloaded build).

**Immutable installs** (Flatpak, Snap, Nix) are detected at runtime — `FLATPAK_ID`/`/.flatpak-info`, `SNAP`, an executable under `/nix/store`, the `QUARK_IMMUTABLE_INSTALL=1` env var (set by the Nix wrapper on Linux), or a `.quark-immutable` marker file beside the executable — and the updater disables itself: `update_check` reports "no update", `:update` explains that updates come from the system package manager, and Settings → About swaps the Updates controls for the same hint (the `update_supported` IPC command carries the flag to the frontend). The marker file exists because neither of the other Nix signals survives on macOS: there is no shell wrapper to set the env var for a Finder or Dock launch, and nix-darwin rsyncs the `.app` out of the store into `/Applications/Nix Apps`, so the `/nix/store` path check no longer matches. The darwin build drops the marker into `Quark.app/Contents/MacOS/`.

### F-Droid repository (Android)

Android updates ship through a **self-hosted F-Droid repository** at `https://quark.tel/fdroid/repo` (added in an F-Droid client via that URL plus the repo fingerprint). It is not the official f-droid.org repo — no submission or review is involved.

The repo is assembled on every Pages deploy (`pages.yml`): CI downloads the newest published release's `*-android.apk` from GitHub Releases, then `fdroid update` (config in `fdroid/`) generates and signs the package index into the Pages artifact — no APK or index is ever committed to git. Two signing keys are involved: the APK key (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` secrets, signs the app) and the repo key (`FDROID_KEYSTORE_*` secrets, signs the index; its certificate's SHA-256 is the pinned fingerprint users add). If the F-Droid secrets are absent the site deploys without `/fdroid/repo`. App listing metadata (name, description, license) lives in `fdroid/metadata/tel.quark.app.yml`.

## App Icons

Every icon ships from one hand-edited file: `src-tauri/icons/quarklogo32.png`, the
logo at its native **32×32** grid. The logo is pixel art, so all scaling is done by
**integer** nearest-neighbour steps — a fractional resize smears every block edge.

```bash
./scripts/gen-icons.sh          # regenerate everything, in the required order
```

| Output | Content | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `icons/icon.png` (master, 512px) | 81.25% (13× art) | Padding for desktop, Windows tiles, iOS |
| `icons/android-foreground.png` | 62.5% (10× art) | Fits Android's 66.67% adaptive safe zone |

Padding is set by the two scale factors at the top of `scripts/gen-icons.sh`; the
content fraction is `scale × 32 / 512`. Only integer scales are accepted.

The pipeline exists because `pnpm tauri icon` alone gets three things wrong here:

- It **rewrites `icons/icon.png`** with a bilinear resample of its own input, so the
  master is regenerated afterwards — otherwise every run softens it a little more.
- Because `src-tauri/gen/{android,apple}` exist, it writes the mobile icons
  **straight into the gen trees** and never touches `icons/android/` or `icons/ios/`.
  The gen tree is therefore the source, and `icons/android/` is refreshed *from* it;
  copying the other way overwrites the freshly generated icons with stale ones.
- Its iOS set is white-backed and bilinear, so `scripts/gen-ios-icons.py` replaces it
  last — compositing on black at full resolution before a nearest-neighbour resize,
  and writing RGB with no alpha (the App Store rejects icons with an alpha channel).

`src-tauri/icons/app-icon.json` is the Tauri icon manifest (`default`, `bg_color`,
`android_fg`). Note that its documented `android_fg_scale` key is a **no-op** in the
current CLI — padding the `android_fg` image is what actually works.

`tauri icon` also emits the `.icns` chunks in a nondeterministic order, so the
pipeline canonicalizes them; without that, an unchanged icon shows up as a ~190KB
binary diff on every run. Regenerating with no source change is a no-op.
