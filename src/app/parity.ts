// Modality reachability — the model the parity test asserts against (#104).
//
// The milestone's whole claim is that every feature is reachable from keyboard,
// mouse and touch. That claim decays the moment someone adds an action, so it
// is stated here as a predicate rather than as prose in DESIGN.md, and the test
// next door fails a build that breaks it.
//
// The command palette is the universal net, which is exactly why reachability
// "via the palette" is tracked separately: a test that accepted it everywhere
// would pass vacuously and prove nothing. `reachability()` reports the two
// independently so the test can require real affordances where they should
// exist and still recognise the palette as a genuine path.
