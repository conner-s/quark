// Android back-button handler.
//
// Tauri's WryActivity routes hardware back-press to `WebView.goBack()`. If
// there's nothing in the WebView history to go back to, the press falls
// through to `super.onBackPressed()` and the app exits.
//
// We hijack that by seeding one history entry on startup, so the OS back
// press fires a `popstate` event in JS instead of exiting. The handler
// below decides what "back" should mean given the current UI state, then
// re-pushes the placeholder entry so subsequent presses keep firing.
//
// Precedence (from highest to lowest):
//   1. Any modal/overlay open → close the top one
//   2. Member list panel open → close it
//   3. Thread view open → close it
//   4. Drawer open → close drawer
//   5. Drawer closed → open drawer (per issue #31's request)
//
// iOS has no hardware back button; this module is a no-op on non-Android
// platforms. We still seed history on every platform — `history.pushState`
// is harmless and `popstate` is only ever fired by deliberate navigation.
