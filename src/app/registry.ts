// The action registry — one source of truth for what Quark can do.
//
// Before this module the same action was described in four places that drifted
// apart: KNOWN_COMMANDS (tab completion), the executeCommand switch (behaviour),
// HelpDialog's COMMANDS/BINDINGS tables (documentation), and the inline
// ContextMenuEntry literals in keyboard.ts (menus, with hardcoded `hint:`
// strings that lied as soon as the user remapped anything). `:room-settings`
// executed but never tab-completed; Help omitted fourteen implemented commands
// and advertised `:upload`, a stub.
//
// So the *metadata* lives here and the *behaviour* stays where it was. Every
// entry carries a stable `id`; consumers look an entry up and read whatever
// facet they need — command name and aliases, default binding, menu label and
// grouping, which surfaces the action is reachable from. Behaviour keeps living
// in dispatchAction (for the no-argument actions) and executeCommand (for the
// ones that parse arguments), both of which now switch on the registry's id
// rather than on raw user input, so an alias is resolved exactly once.
//
// This file is deliberately free of UI and action-layer imports: the parity
// test (#104) and the command palette (#98) both need to read the registry
// without dragging the DOM in behind it. The one runtime import is the keymap
// manager, which is itself dependency-free, and only for resolving a *live*
// binding — the whole point being that a menu hint reflects the user's quarkrc
// rather than what the default happened to be when the menu was written.
