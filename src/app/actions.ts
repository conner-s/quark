// Action dispatcher — connects IPC calls to UI state updates.
//
// This file was historically a 3000-line god-module containing all 61 action
// functions plus their shared module state and helpers. It has been split into
// domain-scoped modules under `actions/` (see `actions/context.ts` for the
// shared state/helpers that every domain module reads from).
//
// This file is now a barrel: it re-exports every name that was previously
// exported here, with identical signatures, so existing importers (keyboard.ts,
// sync.ts, back.ts, ui/ components, …) need no changes. Add new action
// functions to the appropriate domain module and re-export them below.

// Shared context: components ref, dedupe set, pagination view flag, and a few
// timeline/avatar helpers that are also part of the public action surface.
